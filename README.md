# actionGame

An action game currently just a test of moving a character and camera around a few platforms and collecting items. WIP, obviously!

## OS X Build

Dowload the folder "actionTest.app" to get the OS X build of the game. This is the app "file" for the game (GitHub treats it as a folder for obvious reasons :))

## Windows Build

Coming Soon!

## Controls

KB/M: 
Move - WASD
Jump - Space
Rotate Camera - J and L

Xbox 360 Controller:
Move - Left Analog
Jump - A
Rotate camera - Right Analog (this may be broken on the OS X build, as I've been testing using my trusty DualShock 3!)

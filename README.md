# actionGame

An action game currently just a test of moving a character and camera around a few platforms and collecting items. WIP, obviously!

## OS X Build

Dowload the folder "macBuild.zip" file to get the actiontest.app file.

## Windows Build

Download the "pcBuild.zip" file to get the data folder and .exe for actionTest. These must be in the same directory to work!

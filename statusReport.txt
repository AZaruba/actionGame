Status Report: 5/31/17

Accomplishments:
  - Falling off ledges from collision now works!
  - Coin collection is now implemented via collision layer 8
  - Coin collection tracked in the UI!
  - on "death" everything resets back to one!
  
  - Two gem models made and successfully imported
  - We now have a jiggy/star item that can only be collected after collecting all gems
  - Double jumping (Spyro-esque flutter) implemented
  - Gravity tweaked
  - Lighting solution found
    - unfortuantely the PSX shader doesn't play nicely with lighting
    - We will either figure this out later or scrap doing the shaky polygons :(

To-Do (5/29-6/02):
  - Figure out good lighting so the gems are readable in low resolution (Done, sadly!)
   - Implement some state change (i.e. attacking)
    - Reflect the state change via some visual indicator (texture change?)
  - Start building a real level! (blender)
  - Display coin text over the "Goal Item" like Crash Bandicoot (Done!)

Stretch Goal:
  - Add some form of heads-up UI (DONE!!!!)
  - Start making a hero
  - Dodging
  - Implement an enemy

Status Report: 5/16/17

Accomplishments:
  - Game started!
  - Camera movement relative to player working
  - Player movement working, need it to be relative to camera
  - Looks very PlayStation 1-ish :)

To-Do (5/17-5/20):
  - Make player movement work relative to camera
    - This requires having the input axis vector to be transformed to the space
      formed by the vector CAMERA->PLAYER
  - Implement some state change (i.e. attacking)
    - Reflect the state change via some visual indicator (texture change?)

Stretch Goal:

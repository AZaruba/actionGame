Status Report: 5/25/17

Accomplishments:
  - Falling off ledges from collision now works!
  - Coin collection is now implemented via collision layer 8

To-Do (5/26-6/02):
  - Score tracking!
  - Split up collision detection into a single script
    - I'm thinking one collider per object type
    - Check if the layerMask word can be used to do this in one sweep
  - Implement some state change (i.e. attacking)
    - Reflect the state change via some visual indicator (texture change?)
  - Start building a real level! (blender)

Stretch Goal:
  - Add some form of heads-up UI (health in text, for example)

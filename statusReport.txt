Status Report: 5/23/17

Accomplishments:
  - Game started!
  - Camera movement relative to player working
  - Player movement working including jumping and universal collision
  - Looks very PlayStation 1-ish :)

To-Do (5/24-5/28):
  - Fix the camera going wonky on landing
  - Implement falling off ledges (so we don't have to jump to start falling)
  - Implement some state change (i.e. attacking)
    - Reflect the state change via some visual indicator (texture change?)

Stretch Goal:
  - Add some form of heads-up UI (health in text, for example)
  - Start modeling!! Make a cool world (like a beach and a glass platform!)

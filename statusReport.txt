Status Report: 5/29/17

Accomplishments:
  - Falling off ledges from collision now works!
  - Coin collection is now implemented via collision layer 8
  - Coin collection tracked in the UI!
  - on "death" everything resets back to one!
  
  - Two gem models made and successfully imported

To-Do (5/29-6/02):
  - Figure out good lighting so the gems are readable in low resolution
  - Split up collision detection into a single script
    - This MAY not work, given the jumpy mess it was when I tried it
  - Implement some state change (i.e. attacking)
    - Reflect the state change via some visual indicator (texture change?)
  - Start building a real level! (blender)

Stretch Goal:
  - Add some form of heads-up UI (DONE!!!!)
  - Start making a hero
  - Dodging
  - Implement an enemy

Status Report: 6/2/17
Accomplishments:
  - Two gem models made and successfully imported
  - We now have a jiggy/star item that can only be collected after collecting all gems
  - Double jumping (Spyro-esque flutter) implemented
  - Gravity tweaked
  - Lighting solution found
    - unfortuantely the PSX shader doesn't play nicely with lighting
    - We will either figure this out later or scrap doing the shaky polygons :(
  - Solved modeling issues (normals, rotation, and scaling)
  - Fixed XInput issues on PC
  - Added a more interesting font!
  - Added elegant solution to the coin counter
  - Janky Wall collision!
  - Ceiling collision works but character does not FALL (merely gets stuck)
  - Dashing implemented! (uses Coroutines)
  - Gravity better normalized (hopefully finally done!)

To-Do (5/29-6/02):
  - Figure out good lighting so the gems are readable in low resolution (Done, sadly!)
   - Implement some state change (i.e. attacking) (Done!)
    - Reflect the state change via some visual indicator (texture change?)
  - Start building a real level! (blender) (Done, but not committed yet)
  - Display coin text over the "Goal Item" like Crash Bandicoot (Done!)

Stretch Goal:
  - Add some form of heads-up UI (DONE!!!!)

Status Report: 6/4/17
Accomplishments:
  - Text only appears when collecting a gem, fades out correctly now!
  - Code now supports multiple scores being tracked (so multiple gem types can be messed with!)
  - "Look Rotation is Zero" spam fixed
  - Menu screen made, methodology in mind but a hacky solution implemented

To-Do (6/03-6/09):
  - Fix fading out (make it start over instead of sort of re-fizzling out) DONE!
  - Continue building a level (The coral forest!)
  - Implement tracking of multiple gem types DONE! (Potentially)
  - Experiment with scene changes/a main menu DONE!

Stretch Goals:
  - Start making a hero
  - Implement an enemy
  - Better wall collision
     - To keep this idea in mind:
       We want the x and z components to the player movement, normalized and
       the same for the normal of whatever wall we collide with (find an elegant
       collision solution later). From there we want to subtract the value of
       the normalized wall vector with the player vector to only cancel out
       the movement in that direction (so you can still "slide" along walls)

     - Try and poke holes in this idea before implementing?
  - SLOPES!

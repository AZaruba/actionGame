Status Report: 6/4/17
Accomplishments:
  - Text only appears when collecting a gem, fades out correctly now!
  - Code now supports multiple scores being tracked (so multiple gem types can be messed with!)
  - "Look Rotation is Zero" spam fixed
  - Menu screen made, methodology in mind but a hacky solution implemented
  - Wall collision plays nicely now! The below solution works
    - still need better way to hitbox the player, as Mr. Boxington can clip into the walls slightly
To-Do (6/03-6/09):
  - Fix fading out (make it start over instead of sort of re-fizzling out) DONE!
  - Continue building a level (The coral forest!)
  - Implement tracking of multiple gem types DONE! (Potentially)
  - Experiment with scene changes/a main menu DONE!

Stretch Goals:
  - Start making a hero
  - Implement an enemy
  - Better wall collision DONE! (barring some quirks found later)
  - SLOPES!
